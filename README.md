# Energy_Consumption_Prediction

The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed the way we interact with technology and our daily lives. The integration of sensors, devices, and data analytics has made it possible to collect, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real-time. One of the most significant applications of IoT technology is in the field of smart homes. Smart homes are equipped with sensors and devices that can monitor and control various aspects of the home environment, including temperature, lighting, security, and energy usage. These devices generate a vast amount of data that can be used to reduce energy usage, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. 
          The dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the relationship between energy consumption and weather patterns, and for developing models to predict energy consumption. In this project, we aim to analyze this dataset and explore the factors affecting energy consumption in smart homes. Our analysis will involve data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques. We will also develop models to predict future energy consumption.
          
This project can be used to reduce energy consumption in smart homes based on weather conditions. By predicting changes in energy consumption patterns, homeowners can adjust their energy usage accordingly, resulting in cost savings and reduced energy consumption. Overall, this project combines data exploration, preprocessing, time-series analysis, and machine learning techniques to analyze a smart home dataset and develop models that can predict changes in energy consumption patterns based on weather conditions. The insights and models developed in this project have practical applications for optimizing energy consumption in smart homes, and can be extended to other domains such as industrial automation and energy management.
The dataset contains a total of 503910 data points and 32 features, namely: time, use, gen, House overall, Dishwasher, Home office, Fridge, Wine cellar, Garage door, Barn, Well, Microwave, Living room, Solar, temperature, icon, humidity, visibility, summary, apparentTemperature, pressure, windSpeed, cloudCover, windBearing, precipIntensity, dewPoint, precipProbability, Furnace and Kitchen.
